# Application-Task-

## About 

This project uses [Vilnius API](https://api.vilnius.lt/) provided waste disposal data. :recycle: 

## Task
- Use any public API or make own to load JSON with 5000+ records; :white_check_mark:

- Use vanilla js or any framework you like to implement data representation table (at least 3 columns); :white_check_mark:

- Click on any column header it should sort the table by particular column, next click should reverse order; :white_check_mark:

- Add pagination. Leave the possibility to see all records at once; :white_check_mark:

- Output last clicked table cell data somewhere on the screen outside table. Change color of last clicked row; :white_check_mark:

- Have a strong concern about performance; :white_check_mark:

- Commit source to a public repository (GitHub) and send the link; :white_check_mark:

- Would be nice to have a live demo online. :white_check_mark:
