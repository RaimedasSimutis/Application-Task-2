# Application-Task-2

## Task
 Use any public API or make own to load JSON with 5000+ records;

- Use vanilla js or any framework you like to implement data representation table (at least 3 columns);

- Click on any column header it should sort the table by particular column, next click should reverse order;

- Add pagination. Leave the possibility to see all records at once;

- Output last clicked table cell data somewhere on the screen outside table. Change color of last clicked row;

- Have a strong concern about performance;

- Commit source to a public repository (GitHub) and send the link;

- Would be nice to have a live demo online.
