# Application-Task-

## About 

This project uses [Vilnius API](https://api.vilnius.lt/) provided waste disposal data. :recycle: 
Here you can find such "useful" information as waste pickup times and locations, waste containers weights
and other, nasty things related stuff. :poop: Also, while using app, please feel free to reward yourself with some great music inside. :blush:

P.S. Table has more than 6800+ rows of records, so be careful while abusing "view all" button 
(which actually shouldn't even be there). :eyes: 

[DEMO](https://application-task-2.vercel.app/)

## Task
- Use any public API or make own to load JSON with 5000+ records; :white_check_mark:

- Use vanilla js or any framework you like to implement data representation table (at least 3 columns); :white_check_mark:

- Click on any column header it should sort the table by particular column, next click should reverse order; :white_check_mark:

- Add pagination. Leave the possibility to see all records at once; :white_check_mark:

- Output last clicked table cell data somewhere on the screen outside table. Change color of last clicked row; :white_check_mark:

- Have a strong concern about performance; :white_check_mark:

- Commit source to a public repository (GitHub) and send the link; :white_check_mark:

- Would be nice to have a live demo online. :white_check_mark:
